# Review of Web Development Tools

As a web developer, I always look for tools that can help me improve my skills and productivity. That's why I use these browser extensions that make my web development work easier and more efficient. Here are some of the tools that I use and why I use them:

- **Wappalyzer**: This tool helps me identify the technologies used on any website, such as the web server, content management system, analytics, frameworks, and more. It helps me learn from other websites and discover new technologies that I can use for my own projects. For example, I can see what kind of CMS or framework a website is using, and then I can research more about it and see if it suits my needs.
- **Stylus**: This tool helps me customize the appearance of any website by applying my own CSS styles. It helps me experiment with different designs and layouts, and also fix some of the issues that I encounter on some websites, such as font size, color scheme, or responsiveness. For example, I can change the font size or color of a website that I find too small or too bright, and make it more comfortable for me to read.
- **JSON View**: This tool helps me format and validate JSON data that I receive from APIs or other sources. It helps me read and understand the data more easily, and also debug any errors that might occur in the data. For example, I can see the structure and values of the JSON data in a clear and organized way, and also check if there are any syntax or logical errors in the data.
- **HTML Validator**: This tool helps me check the HTML code of any website for errors and warnings, and displays them in the browser. It helps me ensure that my code is valid and follows the standards, and also improve the quality and performance of my website. For example, I can see if there are any missing tags, attributes, or values in the HTML code, and also get suggestions on how to fix them.
- **Measure-it**: This tool helps me measure the dimensions of any element on a website, such as images, text, or buttons. It helps me align and position the elements more precisely, and also optimize the layout and design of my website. For example, I can see the exact width and height of an image or a button, and then adjust them to fit the grid or the screen size.
- **REST Client**: This tool helps me send and receive HTTP requests to any API or web service, and view the response in the browser. It helps me test and debug the functionality and performance of my API, and also explore and learn from other APIs that are available on the web. For example, I can send a GET or POST request to an API endpoint, and then see the status code, headers, and body of the response, and also analyze the data or the error message.
- **ColorZilla**: This tool helps me pick and generate colors for my website, and also analyze the colors used on any website. It helps me create and apply a consistent and appealing color scheme for my website, and also get inspired by the colors used by other websites. For example, I can use the color picker or the color wheel to choose a color, and then copy the hex code or the RGB value of the color, and also see the complementary or analogous colors.
- **Selenium IDE**: This tool helps me record and playback automated tests for my website, and also edit and debug the tests in the browser. It helps me ensure that my website works as expected and meets the requirements, and also save time and effort in testing my website. For example, I can record a test scenario, such as filling a form or clicking a button, and then playback the test and see if it passes or fails, and also modify the test steps or the parameters if needed.
- **Web Developer**: This tool helps me with a variety of features and options to manipulate and inspect any website, such as disabling JavaScript, viewing source code, editing cookies, validating links, and more. It helps me enhance and modify the functionality and behavior of my website, and also troubleshoot and solve any problems that I might face on my website. For example, I can disable JavaScript or CSS on a website, and see how it affects the layout or the interactivity of the website, and also identify any potential issues or bugs.
- **WhatFont**: This tool helps me identify the fonts used on any website, and also view the font properties, such as size, weight, style, and color. It helps me choose and apply the best fonts for my website, and also learn from the fonts used by other websites. For example, I can hover over any text on a website, and see the name and the details of the font, and also compare it with other fonts or websites.
- **What run's**: This tool helps me discover what runs any website, such as the plugins, widgets, frameworks, analytics, and more. It helps me find and use the best tools for my website, and also keep track of the trends and innovations in web development. For example, I can see what kind of plugins or widgets a website is using, and then I can research more about them and see if they can improve the functionality or the user experience of my website.

These are some of the tools that I use and why I use them. I hope you find them useful and helpful for your web development work. If you want to know more about these tools, you can check out their websites or their reviews on the web.
