# About  

This is a space where everything I learn finds its way—from Unix shell commands to software engineering, from tools I rely on to those I might explore someday. It’s a blend of computer science, editor tweaks, browser extensions, and AI experiments, capturing the journey of discovery and creation. Not just a blog, but a living collection of ideas, insights, and tools that shape my path forward.
