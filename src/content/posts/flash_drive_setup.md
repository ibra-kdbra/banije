# Flash Drive Setup and Recovery on Linux

This document provides a step-by-step guide to checking, recovering, and formatting a flash drive on Linux.

---


## **Step 1: Verify Disk Information**

List all connected drives to identify the correct device:
```bash
sudo fdisk -l
```

- This command lists all disk partitions and details such as disk size, sector size, and partition layout.
- **Output** will help confirm the actual capacity of the flash drive (e.g., `/dev/sdb`).

---

## **Step 2: Check for Errors**

Install and use `smartctl` to perform a health check:
1. Install the `smartmontools` package:
   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S smartmontools
   ```
2. Get detailed device information:
   ```bash
   sudo smartctl -i /dev/sdb
   ```
3. Run a non-destructive health test (if supported):
   ```bash
   sudo smartctl -t long /dev/sdb
   ```

- **Note**: If tests fail with errors like "unsupported SCSI opcode," the device might not support SMART features.

---

## **Step 3: Wipe the Disk**

To erase all data, including the partition table:
```bash
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=1M count=10
```

- **Explanation**: 
  - `if=/dev/zero`: Input file is `/dev/zero` (produces zeroed-out bytes).
  - `of=/dev/sdb`: Output file is the flash drive.
  - `bs=1M`: Block size is 1MB.
  - `count=10`: Write 10 blocks (10MB).

---

## **Step 4: Create a New Partition Table**

Launch `fdisk` to create a new partition layout:
```bash
sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
```

- **Commands in `fdisk`**:
  1. Create a new partition table (MBR):
     ```
     o
     ```
  2. Create a primary partition:
     ```
     n
     ```
  3. Accept defaults for partition number, start, and end sectors to use the entire disk.
  4. Write changes to disk:
     ```
     w
     ```

Verify the partition table:
```bash
sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb
```

---

## **Step 5: Format the Partition**

Format the newly created partition with your desired file system:
- For Linux-only systems (ext4):
  ```bash
  sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
  ```
- For cross-platform compatibility (FAT32):
  ```bash
  sudo mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sdb1
  ```

---

## **Step 6: Mount the Partition**

1. Create a mount point:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /mnt/flashdrive
   ```
2. Mount the partition:
   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/flashdrive
   ```
3. Verify the mount:
   ```bash
   df -h
   ```

---

## **Optional: Test Flash Drive for Counterfeiting**

If the drive shows incorrect capacity, use `f3` to verify its true size:
1. Install `f3`:
   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S f3
   ```
2. Test the drive:
   ```bash
   sudo f3probe --destructive --time-ops /dev/sdb
   ```

---

## **Conclusion**

By following these steps, you can recover and set up a flash drive, ensuring its capacity and functionality are restored. For additional automation, you can add the partition to `/etc/fstab` for persistent mounting.
