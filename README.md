Install pnpm globally if you haven't:
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ibra-kdbra/banije.git
   cd banije
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm add sharp
   ```

3. Edit the config file `src/config.ts` to customize your blog.

4. Create a new post:
   ```bash
   pnpm new-post <filename>
   ```
   This will create a new file in `src/content/posts/` for you to edit.

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
   Visit `http://localhost:4321` to see your blog.

6. Deploy your blog to Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc., following [the guides](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/). Update the site configuration in `astro.config.mjs` before deployment.

## ⚙️ Frontmatter of Posts

Each post in `src/content/posts/` uses YAML frontmatter for metadata. Here's the structure:

```yaml
---
title: My First Blog Post              # Post title (required)
published: 2023-09-09                  # Publication date in YYYY-MM-DD format (required)
description: This is the first post... # Brief description for SEO and previews (required)
image: ./cover.jpg                     # Cover image path relative to post folder (optional)
tags: [Foo, Bar]                       # Array of tags for categorization (optional)
category: Front-end                    # Main category (optional)
draft: false                           # Set to true to hide from production (optional, default: false)
lang: jp                               # Language code if different from site default (optional)
---
```

**Notes:**
- `title`, `published`, and `description` are required fields.
- Images should be placed in the same folder as the post file.
- Tags and category help with organization and search.
- Draft posts won't appear in the live site.
