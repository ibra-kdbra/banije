## 📋 Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher)
- **pnpm** package manager
- **Git** for version control

Install pnpm globally if you haven't:
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ibra-kdbra/banije.git
   cd banije
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm add sharp # Required for Astro image processing
   ```

3. **Customize your blog**:
   Edit the configuration file at `src/config.ts` to tailor the blog to your needs.

4. **Create a new post**:
   ```bash
   pnpm new-post <filename>
   ```
   This will scaffold a new file in `src/content/posts/` for you to edit.

5. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
   Visit `http://localhost:4321` to see your changes in real-time.

6. **Build & Deploy**:
   Build your production site to the `./dist/` directory:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```
   Follow [the Astro guides](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) to deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

## ⚙️ Frontmatter Specification

Each post in `src/content/posts/` uses YAML frontmatter. All fields below are standard:

```yaml
---
title: "Post Title"                # (Required)
published: YYYY-MM-DD              # (Required)
description: "Brief SEO summary"    # (Required)
image: "/images/posts/cover.png"   # (Optional) Cover image path
tags: [Tag1, Tag2, Tag3]           # (Optional) Max 3 tags recommended
category: "Architecture"           # (Optional) Main technical pillar
draft: false                       # (Optional) Default: false
---
```

**Notes:**
- `title`, `published`, and `description` are required for the build to pass.
- Images should be placed in the `public/images/posts/` directory or relative to the post.
- Tags and categories enable the dynamic filtering and search systems.

## 🛠️ Translation Workflow (Free)

The project includes a free translation pipeline based on `google-translate-api-x` and custom scripts.

**Core Capabilities:**
- **Structure Preservation**: Protects Markdown fences, links, admonitions, and Svelte embeds.
- **Technical Glossary**: Uses `scripts/translation-glossary.json` to protect technical terms.
- **Caching**: Uses content hashes to avoid re-translating unchanged files.
- **Validation**: Ensures the translated output matches the required frontmatter shape.

**Useful Commands:**
- `pnpm translate -- --lang=tr --skip-existing`: Translate only Turkish, skipping existing files.
- `pnpm translate -- --post=gitCommands --lang=ja`: Translate one specific post to Japanese.
- `pnpm translate:fix`: Post-process and repair known translation artifacts.

## 📊 Interactive Diagrams

Banije features a custom-built, declarative interactive diagram system powered by **Svelte 5** and **Gemini AI**.

### Features:
- **Portaled Focus Mode**: A premium fullscreen overlay that escapes parent container constraints for a cinematic experience.
- **Precision Zoom**: Smooth 1.8x zoom capability for high-detail technical diagrams.
- **Smart Hotspots**: Interactive bounding boxes with glassmorphism effects and smooth transitions.
- **Dev-Only Visual Debugger**: An integrated coordinate tracker and hitbox highlighter that automatically appears in `DEV` mode (`pnpm dev`) to help with alignment.
- **Mobile Responsive**: Transitions from a split-screen layout on desktop to a native-feeling bottom-sheet on mobile.

### AI Automation (Auto-Labeling):
You can automatically generate the coordinate JSON for any image using Gemini Vision:

1. Place your image in `public/images/posts/`.
2. Run the generator:
   ```bash
   pnpm interactive:gen public/images/posts/your-diagram.webp
   ```
3. A `.json` file will be created next to your image. Use it in Markdown:
   ```markdown
   ::interactive{id="my-id" src="/images/posts/img.webp" data="src/images/posts/img.json"}
   ```

### Debugging & Alignment:
While running `pnpm dev`, move your mouse over any `::interactive` component to see real-time X/Y percentages. Clicking the image will log the exact coordinates to your browser console for easy fine-tuning.

## 🖼️ Image Optimization

To ensure fast page loads, Banije includes a built-in image optimization pipeline powered by **Sharp**.

### Features:
- **Automatic Compression**: Reduces file size without noticeable quality loss.
- **WebP Generation**: Automatically creates `.webp` variants for better browser support.
- **Responsive Resizing**: Scales large images down to a maximum width (default: 1600px).
- **Format Conversion**: Optimizes JPG, PNG, and WebP files in-place.

### Usage:
```bash
# Preview savings without changing files
pnpm images:optimize:dry

# Optimize all images in public/images/posts
pnpm images:optimize
```
